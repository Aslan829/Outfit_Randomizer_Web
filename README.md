# Overview

This assignment is to learn the basics of React in a web application. I wanted to practice using a database and I am still setting that up. 

This document is an outfit randomizer that will display a random image based on the user's selection. The user has an option to choose a random shirt and pants combo, dress, or shoes.

# Web Pages

* Index.html - This is the main page. It contains the 3 buttons that the user can choose which piece of clothing they want randomized.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to customize the React application. I also included the "useState" from react.
